        This person is a PARASITE. he lives on leeching people becaaauussee- he doesn't have income which is a very
        important asset for a living person mygad abdol azez. He can't even do simple jobs like driving or plumbing???
        Luckily, he has a brother who is very very reeEEEeeEEE-lie-able get it? reliable? ahahaahahah anyways, he shares
        household works with his brother and most of his duties are at home mainly preparing and cleaning-up every meal 
        which can be a little tiring considering the number of family members we are 6 in total and man those people are
        so nasty and unkempt like the soiled plates are always hard to clean because they just pile them up and not rinse
        them and the oiliness is ickyy not only not only that but my brother doesn't fix his bed every morning and my sisters
        goodness they only take a bath every 2-3 days i mean like they don't go out much or be doing exercise but still they
        get body odour and its bad talagaaa.

        As a middle child, he didn't get much attention from his parents so he became estranged a bit from them. 
        Early on, his aunts who lives with them along with his mother discovered that he was kinda feminine.
        The way he speaks, subconscious behaviours, and personality all was rebuked.
        The memories of that day remained in his mind forever as he became a shallow shell of himself at home, and even at school.
        Soooo his hobbies for that time were playing mobile games with his brother and get agitated and lash out from time to time at him
        then I also received a nosebleed when we fought too much and it was a CORE memory indeed. And when left alone, he liked 
        reading queer webnovels in wattpad where he was able to release his other self all night long. mmmmmmm those were cringe 
        lonely emo days glad that was over.

        Now at the present, He has gained 2 trusted friend where he can confide with and be crazy together as well as support
        and care with. He is now more stable than ever compared to his past. Today he is still an avid mobile gamer playing 
        games of the current trend like Genshin Impact and Mobile Legends. A more responsible child as he became more active in
        taking care of the house. And became a person with a goal in life. He is now mature at the age of 19 as he learned more
        of the hardships, the people, the differences in life, and the uniqueness of the aspirations of each person. He wants to
        reset his life in another country where no one knows him. No relatives. No childhood classmates. And be calm.

    <h1>Goal in the Future</h1>
    <p>
        10 years from now, I see myself as a corporate professional working as a data analyst in an intermediate firm. I would be
        visiting a nearby 24 hr cafe at night after an overtime at work. Smelling the whiff of caffeine and hearing the blender 
        whirring as it brews. As I find a sit where I can see the glass wall and look at the quiet street as people walk by.

        But my real goal is to become a freelancer, and own a small cafe side bookshop somewhere in japan and find love. Amen.
    </p>
